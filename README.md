## Welcome to CINDERellA!

The goal of this project is to enable you to run causal Bayesian networks that accurately predict up and downstream genes and entire regulatory networks on the basis of gene expression or gene expression+genetics.

You can read more about methods included in this toolbox in [this paper in Genetics](http://www.genetics.org/content/early/2015/01/28/genetics.114.172619.full.pdf+html) where we compare their performance across ~14,000 realistic networks.
